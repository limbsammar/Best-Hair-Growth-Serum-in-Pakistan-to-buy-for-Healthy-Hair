**Biotin hair growth serum**

Biotin hair serum, made in the United States, is renowned for its effectiveness in nations like Pakistan and beyond. If your hair is unhealthy, this is one of the greatest ways to stimulate its follicles and encourage growth, which will ultimately help your hair grow longer.

Biotin stimulates hair follicles and aids in creating keratin. Your hair will appear fuller, healthier, and more vibrant after just a few uses of a biotin hair growth formula. You can get it shipped from any online store in Pakistan for a minimum of PKR 1800.

**Streax Pro Hair Serum**

If your hair is prone to frizz, this is a great option. Streax Pro immediately smooths out rough hair by sealing in moisture. The vitamin E in the Streax Pro formula helps the hair's cuticles stay healthy, making for silkier hair. It's one of the priciest options out there, but the quality of the result justifies the cost. It can be had for about 3000 and 4000 PKR.
